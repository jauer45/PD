# PD
Pure Data Projects, Modules and default Audio Samples. Feel free to use, borrow, modify as you wish; 
open source. If, for whatever strange reason you wish to use a significant set of the code of a pd 
module/patch it would be appreciated if you could reference my authorship/contribution. Thanks :-)

Requisits:
  1. Make sure you are running latest stable build of Pd at least. Um, that should be it.
  

Notes:
  1. These patches were made on a Windows XP machines, (yes, you read that correctly). Mac, Linux and
    other Windows OS versions have not been tested yet. 

  2. In a Pd patch or/and module where a file path is hardcoded, (early days here and currently 
     in the process of learning to use openpanel effectively), please change the 
     filepath(s) to your audio storage area for WAV file audio file reads, 
     (You may need to do Cntrl+E to enter Edit Mode).
